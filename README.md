# Business Problem – Sales Pipeline Conversion in a SaaS Startup

This assignment is based on a case study on TechnoServe, a fictitious tech SaaS (software as a service) startup that specializes in offering various software services to small and medium enterprise customers. The products offered by the company are geared towards increasing productivity for its customers. Its software solutions are customized based on the customers’ needs and the amount they are willing to spend on a product.

As TechnoServe is a SaaS provider, its revenue is highly dependent on the number of clients. However, the company faces a pertinent problem that is prevalent in the IT industry today: declining conversions across its sales funnel. This means the company is failing to convert its potential customers into clients.

The company’s sales pipeline conversion percentage has dropped from 35% at the end of the last fiscal (FY 2017-18) to 25% at present.

## Project Objective

To understand the problem, suggest hypotheses for the low conversions faced by TechnoServe and analyze the data set to arrive at possible solutions to increase the conversions.
